We comparing the CM gene expression profile of juvenile and adult mice, 
to test whether during regeneration the myocytes revert the translational
phenotype to a less differentiated state.

# Repository Contents

`.qsub` files represent all calls submitted as SCC jobs.
`make_cufflinks_histogram.r` reads the FPKM values generated by cufflinks,
counts the genes with substantial expression, and plots the distribution.
`./analyst/` subdirectory contains all code analyzing differential expression
results.
